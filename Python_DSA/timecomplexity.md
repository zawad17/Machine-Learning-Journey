# -------------tIME COMPLEXITY---------------

FOR CONSTANT TIME COMPLEXITY IS O(1)
FOR SINGLE LOOP TIME COMPLEXITY IS O(N)
FOR DOUBLE LOOP TIME COMPLEXITY IS O(N^2)

PER VARIABLE ---> SPACE COMPLEXITY IS O(1)

# ---EXAMPLE---
for i in range(1, n+1, c):
	for j in range(1, n+1, c):
		# some O(1) expressions


Here time complexity is O(n^2)


# -------Asymptotic Notation --------

1. BIG O - WORST
2. BIG OMEGA - BEST
3. BIG THETA - AVERAGE


O(1) --> WHEN WE FIND OUT DESIRE VALUE AT THE BEGINNING
O(LOG N) --> BINARY SEARCH, BALANCED SEARCH TREE
O(N) --> WE FIND OUR DESIRE VALUE AT THE END IN LINEAR SEARCH 
O(N LOG N) --> MERGE SORT , QUICK SORT
